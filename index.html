                <p class="home-page">After summer comes the rainy season. It lasts from mid-June to the end of September. During this time of year, the sky is cloudy. It drizzles and rains cats and dogs sometimes. Rains provide relief from the oppressive summer heat. Green leaves are developed by the tree. Ponds and rivers are full of water. Monsoon is a boon for farmers. Rainwater softens the soil and makes it suitable for cultivation. Monsoon has some disadvantages. Due to heavy and incessant rainfall, the roads, especially in villages, become muddy.</p>

                <p class="home-page">The Dowry system is bad in society. It has turned the sacred matter of marriage into a business deal. The bride is
                regarded as a marketable commodity. Bride’s parents are often put under inhumane pressure for a handsome dowry.
                Sometimes they become destitute to give their daughters in marriage. In many cases, young brides are brutally tortured
                or pushed to commit suicide. To eliminate this social evil, a complete change in society’s outlook is necessary. Women
                should be treated as equal partners to men.</p>

                <p class="home-page">Everyone knows that paper is made from trees. But when one looks at trees, one cannot imagine that something so soft and
                fragile as the paper is made is so hard and strong. Plant materials such as wood are made of fibres known as cellulose.
                It is the primary ingredient in paper making. Raw wood is first converted into pulp consisting of a mixture of
                Cellulose, lignin, water and some chemicals. The pulp can be made mechanically through grinders or through chemical
                processes. Short fibres are produced by mechanical grinding. The paper produced in this way is weak and is used to make
                newspapers, magazines and phonebooks.</p>
